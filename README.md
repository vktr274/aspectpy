# AspectPy: Replicating AspectJ Constructs in Python

This project aims to replicate the functionality of AspectJ in Python. The chosen AspectJ constructs are `before()`, `after() returning`, `after() throwing`, and `around()` advice. These advice are implemented using Python decorators for functions and methods.

The `before()` advice is implemented as a decorator factory class called `Before`. Similarly, the `after() returning` and `after() throwing` advice are implemented as `AfterReturning` and `AfterThrowing` decorator factory classes, respectively. The `around()` advice is implemented as a decorator factory class called `Around`.

The goal is to make the implementation of these advice as customizable as possible.
